        <!--Mission Statement-->
        <p class="mission">
            BFF Dog Rescue NJ, Inc. is an all-volunteer, no-kill, all-breed dog rescue 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. 
           We have no paid employees and we depend on the financial kindness of animal lovers to continue our work in saving 
           the lives of the dogs we rescue. We host adoption events in Brick, N.J. and the surrounding areas, so check us out 
           on Facebook for an up-to-date list of events. If you are interested in fostering or adopting one of our dogs, please use the button below to 
           download an adoption application and email the completed document to bffdogrescuenj@gmail.com. We will review all 
           applications within <em>two</em> to <em>three</em> days. We require a veterinarian and reference check. Our adoption fee helps to cover 
           our expenses and includes all shots that the dog is old enough to receive, fecal check, spay/neuter, and any other fees 
           required when we rescue. The adoption fee for puppies is $350, adult dogs are $300 and older/senior dogs fees are evaluated 
           on a individual basis.

            <img src="img/twix.jpg" alt="A photograph of our rescue pup">
                <p>Say hello to a 7-month-old Beabull -- a Beagle and Bulldog mix. He is a VERY sweet boy who was surrendered by his owners who didn't have the time to care for him. 
                He has recently been fully vetter and neutered. Twix gets along with kids, dogs, people; cats are unknown but he's such a mush he probably be fine with them.</p>

            <h3>Rylee</h3>
            <img src="img/rylee2.jpg" alt="A photograph of our rescue pup">
            <p>He, I'm Rylee! I am about 7 months old. I was found as a stray and did not weigh much due to malnutrition, so I won't get too big. I am a kissy girl who loves 
            everybody and everything. I will be available for adoption once I get my anemia cured with some healthy food and loving care from us at BFF!</p>

            <h3>Jay</h3>
            <img src="img/jay.jpg" alt="A photograph of our rescue pup">
            <p>Meet Jay, a 13-year-old old Jack Russell surrendered by his family when his owner sadly passed away. Jay is a real sweetheart, does not act his age at all. 
            He's currently being checked at the vet, though he is neutered, gets along with dogs, cats and people.</p>

            <h3>Beau</h3>
            <img src="img/beau.jpg" alt="A photograph of our rescue pup">
            <p>This is Beau, a stray from the Burlington area we think is about a year old. Judging from his face and stout body, we think he's maybe a Neo Mastiff/Cane Corso 
            mix. Beau is a very sweet guy, knows how to give paw and sit. Currently he is in foster care and receiving meds for his skin issues. When he's past his skin 
            issues, he will be neutered. Gets along with people, dogs and cats!</p>
